This is a text file which will be used to store some information and can be used in future to understand some decisions regarding this project.


Step 1

Whenever we create a project, we create the enviornment, activate the enviornment, install all the requirements and etc.
We perform all these one by one. But we have another option from where we can create an init_setup.sh file which a bash script file
which can store all the above commands and can execute all the commands at once. So we just need to execute the bash file and all the
commands like creating enviornment, activating and installing requirements will be done at once only.

Remember, since we have setup.py so we need to install the src package explicitly by "pip install -e . "
